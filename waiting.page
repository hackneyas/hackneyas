## Waiting list information

### Booming interest in allotments leads to waiting list freeze

In June 2008, with the waiting list about to hit 300, the Committee decided to temporarily close the list. This decision was reviewed in October 2009 and upheld again at subsequent AGMs. As at October 2021 there are 48 members on the waiting list with just three vacant plots available.

At the 2017 AGM with the waiting list numbers back to a manageable level it was decided to reopen the list for a limited period to admit up to one hundred new members. The application period ran from 1st March to 15th March 2018. The list is now closed again.

The Society is taking every opportunity to lobby the "Council":https://www.hackney.gov.uk/your-councillors for more allotment provision in the borough and members and others seeking an allotment in Hackney are encouraged to add their weight to this demand.

If you spot any disused land in Hackney which could be converted into possible plots, please send as much information as possible to the [Secretary](mailto:hackneyallotments@gmail.com) who will investigate. 

### Possible alternatives

{:.numberlist}
* Volunteer and sign up for a mini-plot at the [Garden](http://www.castle-climbing.co.uk/garden) project at the Castle Climbing Centre.
* Visit the [Capital Growth](http://capitalgrowth.org/) web site for ideas, contacts and possible funding.
* Try to find an area with a shorter waiting list such as [Waltham Forest](https://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/content/allotments).
* Make use of any available [outside space](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/digin/your_space/) - patios, [balconies](http://www.verticalveg.org.uk/), terraces even window sills can all be potential sites for growing.
