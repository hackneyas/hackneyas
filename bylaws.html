            <h2 id="bylaws">Bylaws</h2>

<p style="color:green"> approved September 2023</p>

<h3 id="conditions-of-tenancy">Conditions of Tenancy</h3>

<p>(1) Each plot shall be let at a rent fixed by the previous year's AGM, payable in advance of or at
the AGM. Any tenant who fails to pay the annual fees due by the end of the calendar year
shall forfeit their plot for reallocation to another member.</p>

<p>(2) The plots shall be let in order of application from a register of applicants kept by the
secretary (should there be more applicants than there are plots available) and in accordance
with the preferences of the waiting list of members.</p>

<p>(3) No plot or part of a plot shall be sublet or transferred without the consent of the
Committee. Only those person(s) named on the tenancy agreement will be recognised as
the tenant(s) of that plot.</p>

<p>(4) No household shall be allowed to rent more than one plot.</p>

<p>(5) A household already having an allotment in Hackney or in another area, either private or
local authority, will be required to choose between being allocated a plot in Hackney or
forfeiting the right to such an allocation and retain its allotment in the other area.</p>

<p>(6) It is likely that during the year, a tenant may be on holiday or away for other reasons, and
thus be unable to tend to his/her plot. If this is for two months or greater, the tenant must
notify their site representative who will bring this to the Committee and the Committee will
decide how this will be handled.</p>

<p>(7) Any tenant wishing to give up their plot permanently should inform both their site
representative and the secretary of HAS. They should aim to remove any personal items
from their plot within two weeks (longer if agreed with the site representative) and return
the key to the allotment site representative. The Society does not make any refund of plot
rental or membership fees.</p>

<h3 id="on-site---general">On Site - General</h3>

<p>(8) The tenant shall be provided with a key to the site and shall enter or leave only by the gate
provided for the purpose, and on leaving must securely lock the gate. A tenant will be
charged for the replacement of a lost key.</p>

<p>(9) Members are expected to treat each other, and in particular, site representatives,
with courtesy and consideration at all times. Rudeness and abuse will not be tolerated, and
will be reported to the Committee. The Committee may decide to investigate further and
this could lead to the loss of a plot and expulsion from the Allotment Society.</p>

<p>(10) The tenant(s) must keep their plot under proper cultivation, according to the
Society's Neglected Plot Policy (available on the website www.hackneyallotments.org.uk). There
are regular inspections during the growing season to ensure that plots are being
used appropriately and to nominate prize-winning plots. The site representative has
the authority to apply the Neglected Plot Policy at any time if they are dissatisfied
with the condition of a plot.</p>

<p>(11) The tenant(s) must show respect for the boundaries of their neighbours’ plots and to be
aware of the safety of themselves and their neighbours on site. This includes using their
best endeavour to protect the site fences, their neighbour’s produce and keep paths in
repair. Any issues about these requirements should be discussed with the site
representative.</p>

<p>(12) There shall be a path of 18 inches between each plot to ensure that tenants can safely 
access their plots and that there are clear demarcation between plots. Tenants must ensure
that they do not encroach on these paths.</p>

<p>(13) The Society supports the LBH Biodiversity Action Plan and Hackney's Local Nature Recovery
Plan. Tenants are therefore requested to comply with appropriate local and national
legislation with regard to preserving and protecting biodiversity, and with the good practice
of the main soil associations. They are therefore not to bring, store or use on the allotment
site any poisons, pesticides and herbicides that are detrimental to biodiversity and the
environment. Exceptions may be made with the agreement of the Committee if special
circumstances arise e.g. to remove rampant invasive species such as Japanese
Knotweed. Any potentially dangerous products should be used with health and safety
requirements in mind and with respect for neighbour's plots and not be stored on site.</p>

<h3 id="on-site---specific">On Site - Specific</h3>

<p>(14) No building may be placed on an allotment without PRIOR agreement of the site
representative. Due consideration must be given to the effect of such a building on
neighbouring plots. If agreement cannot be reached, the site representative will take the
issue to the Managing Committee for a final decision.</p>

<p>(15) Fruit trees must be on dwarf stock to limit the shade they will create, and may not be
planted without PRIOR AGREEMENT of the site representative. Permanent planting of trees
or shrubs should not be made where it could limit access to pathways. If agreement cannot
be reached, the site representative will take the issue to the Managing Committee for a final
decision. Tenants are also expected to remove any self-sown saplings and to maintain
trees/shrubs at a manageable size to limit demands on the Society’s funds for professional
tree surgery.</p>

<p>(16) The site must be kept clean and tidy, with non-compostable rubbish removed as quickly
as possible. The site will be inspected from time to time to ensure that this requirement
is respected.</p>

<p>(17) No dogs shall be allowed on the ground unless on a lead.</p>

<p>(18) Young children are allowed only when accompanied by an adult.</p>

<p>(19) Barbed wire may only be used with the permission of the Committee.</p>

<p>(20) No notice or advertisement is to be erected on the allotment without agreement of the
site-representative.</p>

<p>(21) Water butts are not to be used for the washing of tools, containers or
produce. Many diseases are transmitted in water, i.e., club root, wilts and rust.</p>

<p>(22) Serious and persistent pest problems should be reported to the site representatives.</p>

<p>(23) In order for a site to be designated organic, all members on site must agree to
garden organically. The site will be required to get the approval of the AGM for
confirmation of the designation. Offers to future plot holders will be made subject to the
agreement to garden on an organic basis. Likewise, a site can apply to remove designation.</p>

<p>(24) Plot-holders are to be encouraged to contribute to the upkeep, maintenance
and improvement of their site as a whole. This may be by attending organised work days or
by undertaking individual projects at the request of the site representative.</p>

<p>(25) All the above by-laws shall be strictly enforced. The Society shall have the right of repossession
of a plot for breach or non-performance of any of these by-laws.</p>

<p>(26) Any matters arising, not provided for by these by-laws shall be decided by the Committee.</p>
