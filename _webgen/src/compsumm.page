## Compost project 2005-2006

In the winter of 2005 the Society secured a grant from the NLWA (North London Waste Authority) to develop 'Community Composting Projects' at Spring Hill and Aden Terrace sites. Our aim was simple - build communal compost bins and obtain a reasonably powerful shredding machine.

### Spring Hill

On 3rd December 2005, a dozen or so stalwart volunteers, under the expert guidance of Andrew from Freightliners City Farm, braved fierce showers to construct a large "compost bin":sh_compost.html.

In wintery conditions on 18th and 19th March 2006, volunteers constructed seven communal compost bins, tidied up the site for the start of the growing season and took the opportunity to try out our smart new "shredder":sh_compost2.html.

### Aden Terrace

Two work days have been held to clear the site and create a community composting facility. Thanks to all the plotholders who attended and worked so hard to clear the site and build two [large bins](at_compost.html) on 4th March & 5th April 2006.

There is now a noticeable improvement to the site, particularly the perimeter flower bed and access along the path. The large compost bins are now available for green waste. Woody waste should be stored in the left bin until the next shredding session. Other material can be put in the right hand bin.
