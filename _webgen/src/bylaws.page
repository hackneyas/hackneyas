p. %{color:green}approved 6 November 2013%

1. Each plot shall be let at a rent fixed by the previous year&apos;s AGM or an Emergency General Meeting, payable by the date of the AGM.   Any tenant who fails to pay their annual fees due by the end of the calendar year shall forfeit their plot for reallocation to another member.

2. The plots shall be let in order of application from a register of applicants kept by the secretary [should there be more applicants than there are plots available].

3. Any tenant(s) wishing to give up their plot on a temporary basis may do so with the agreement of the Managing Committee.  This should first be discussed with the site representative who will report the circumstances to the Managing Committee for decision.  The Managing Committee will always take into account whether the plot has been kept in good condition and the length of time of the absence, but there may be other specific circumstances that merit consideration.  If the Managing Committee agrees to a temporary absence, the tenant(s) will be placed at the top of the waiting list, to be reallocated a plot upon their return.   Any tenant wishing to give up their plot permanently should inform both their site representative and the Secretary so the plot may be reallocated as quickly as possible.  The Society does not make any refund of plot rental or membership fees.

4. No plot or part of a plot shall be sublet or transferred without the consent of the Managing Committee.   Only those person(s) named on the tenancy agreement will be recognised as the tenant(s) of that plot.

5. No household shall be allowed to rent more than one plot whilst there is a waiting list.

6. Tenants shall be provided with a key to their site and shall enter or leave only by the gate provided for the purpose, and on leaving must securely lock the gate.  Tenants will be charged for the replacement of lost keys.

7. Tenants must keep their plot under proper cultivation, according to the Society&apos;s Neglected Plot Policy.   There are regular inspections during the growing season to ensure that plots are being cultivated appropriately.

8. Tenants must show respect for the boundaries of their neighbours&apos; plots and be aware of the safety of themselves and their neighbours on site.  This includes using their best endeavour to protect the site fences, their neighbour&apos;s produce and to keep their path in repair.  Any issues about these requirements should be discussed with the site representative.

9. Anything tenants bring onto the allotment site, including poisons or chemicals produced for domestic garden use, should be kept and used with health and safety requirements in mind and with respect for their neighbours&apos; plots.

10. No building may be placed on an allotment without PRIOR AGREEMENT of the site representative.  Due consideration must be given to the effect of such a building on neighbouring plots.  If agreement cannot be reached, the site representative will take the issue to the Managing Committee for a final decision.

11. Fruit trees must be on dwarf stock to limit the shade they will create.  Permanent planting of trees or shrubs should not be made where it could limit access to pathways.  Permanent planting of trees and shrubs may only be done with PRIOR AGREEMENT of the site representative.  If agreement cannot be reached, the site representative will take the issue to the Managing Committee for a final decision.  Tenants are also expected to remove any self-sown saplings and to maintain trees/shrubs at a manageable size to limit demands on the Society&apos;s funds for professional tree surgery.

12.  No dogs shall be allowed on the site unless on a lead.

13. Young children are allowed only when accompanied by an adult.

14. The site must be kept clean and tidy, with non-compostable rubbish removed as quickly as possible.  The site will be inspected from time to time to ensure that this requirement is respected.

15. There shall be a path of 18 inches between each plot to ensure that tenants can safely access their plots and that there are clear demarcation between plots.  Tenants must ensure that they do not encroach on these paths.

16. Barbed wire may only be used with the permission of the Managing Committee. 

17. No notice or advertisement is to be erected on the allotment without agreement of the site representative.

18. Water butts are not to be used for the washing of tools, containers or produce.  Many diseases are transmitted in water, i.e., club root, wilts and rust.

19. The sighting or suspected presence of rats or other vermin should be reported to the site representative at once.

20.	In order for a site to be designated organic, all members on site must agree to garden organically.  The site will be required to get the approval of the AGM for confirmation of the designation.  Offers to future plot holders will be made subject to the agreement to garden organically.  Likewise, a site that is designated as organic may petition the AGM to remove that designation.

21. All the above bylaws shall be strictly enforced.   The Society shall have the right of repossession of a plot for breach or non-performance of any of these bylaws.

22. Any matters arising, not provided for by these bylaws, shall be decided by the Managing Committee.
