h2. About us

p. The Hackney Allotment Society, founded in 1979, is a registered charity 
"(number 294128)":http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=294128&SubsidiaryNumber=0 
managed by a voluntary committee. The aim of the Society is to promote horticulture in the London Borough of Hackney. We have 9 sites across the borough with a total of 133 full plots. Some plots are split into half plots and we have two raised bed plots. Demand for plots is high and a waiting list is maintained. Waiting time is likely to be several years depending on your choice of site.

bq. The most noteworthy thing about gardeners is that they are always optimistic, always enterprising and never satisfied. They always look forward to doing something better than they have ever done before. %{color:black}- Vita Sackville-West%
