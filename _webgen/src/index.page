managed by a voluntary committee. The aim of the Society is to promote horticulture in the London Borough of Hackney. We have 9 sites across the borough with a total of 133 full plots. Some plots are split into half plots and we have two raised bed plots. Demand for plots is high and a waiting list is maintained. Waiting time is likely to be several years depending on your choice of site.
