## About us

The Hackney Allotment Society, founded in 1979, is a registered charity 
[number 294128](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/294128/full-print)
managed by a voluntary committee. The aim of the Society is to promote horticulture in the London Borough of Hackney. We have 9 sites across the borough with a total of 133 full plots. Some plots are split into half plots and we have two raised bed plots. Demand for plots is high and a waiting list is maintained. Waiting time is likely to be several years depending on your choice of site.

### The waiting list for plots will re-open for new members between 1st and 29th February 2024.

The Hackney Allotment Society members agreed at the AGM in October 2023 that the waiting list will be re-opened for a limited period to admit up to one hundred new members. The application period will run from 1st and 29th February 2024.

To apply to become a member of Hackney Allotment Society and join the waiting list for a plot, you must be over 18 years old, a resident of the London Borough of Hackney and not already be an allotment plot holder.

The online application form will be open for applications from 1st Feb 2024 and after the deadline of 29th February passes, one hundred applications will be randomly selected, offered membership and allocated a numbered place on the waiting list.

Membership of the Society is &pound;4 per annum, renewable on 1st October each year.  As a member, you will retain your place on the waiting list, receive regular newsletters, and may attend and vote at the AGM.

### How are plots allocated?

Plots are allocated according to the order of the waiting list, taking into consideration any preferences specified in the application. Members are invited to visit the vacant plot prior to acceptance.  

The plot rent for 2024 is &pound;31 per annum for a full plot (&pound;15.50 concessions) and &pound;15.50 per annum for a half plot (&pound;7.75 concessions). The membership fee of &pound;4 is payable in addition to these amounts.
